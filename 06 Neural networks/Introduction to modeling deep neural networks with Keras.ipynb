    "As we have an idea about how neural networks work, have seen a basic implementation of calculations, we can now look at the most important tool(s) available in Python to model. The tools that we will use are included in the Keras library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library (we will not use that directly in this course), which is a general library for high performance machine learning tasks, built in an end-to-end manner."
